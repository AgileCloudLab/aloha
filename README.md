Aloha is a very simple header only logging framework for C++ aimed at making it trivial to log messages either to standard out or file.

Aloha is developed at Aarhus University, department of Engineering group for Communication Systems in the Agile Cloud Lab for usage in internal C++ application needing an easy to use logging framework.

Aloha is released under the BSD-3 License, see ![LICENSE](https://github.com/AgileCloudLab/aloha/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.

# Usage

There are a couple of ways to use Aloha.

1. Include `src/aloha/aloha.hpp` in your include path
2. Include `src/aloha/aloha.hpp` in your project, totally fine due to the BSD license
3. Install Aloha to your systems `include` folder.

We recommend using option 1 or 2 as it makes it easier to switch to a new version of Aloha.
